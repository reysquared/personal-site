  You're telling me I can write whatever I want here? Like, <em>anything?</em> Wow.
  All this power is kind of humbling. Maybe I should step away from the keyboard.

  Hey there, I'm Kevin, a software engineer from Oakland. This page contains
  information about stuff that I'm doing currently and/or have done in the past.

<p><b>News:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Got married, got a house, aaand... got laid off? All in the same six months. That's an eventful half-year!</li>
  <li>Wow, this pandemic is still going, huh.</li>
  <li><em>Finally</em> updating my website for the first time in ages, check it out:
    <ul>
      <li>Migrated from the Harvey Mudd CS department server to Github Pages</li>
      <li>Re-implemented the entire interface in React (the main webpage still supports noscript though!) over the course of ~2 days</li>
      <li>Added a dark theme option</li>
      <li>Ported some of my ancient, broken Python 2 CGI scripts into new, functioning JavaScript so they can also work on Pages</li>
      <li>Updated the info on here too, obviously</li>
      <li>Did my best to make the interactive elements WAI-ARIA compliant. If you notice any defficiencies, please let me know!</li>

<p>
  Hello, the name's Kevin McSwiggen! My pronouns are they/them. <!-- (or occasionally
  he/him around older relatives.) --> I'm a computer scientist, software engineer,
  and web developer&mdash;three closely-related but distinct hats. I graduated
  from Harvey Mudd College in Spring 2016 and since then have been living in the
  Bay Area with my partner (now spouse!)
</p>
<p>
  I like doing code-y stuff of pretty much any kind. (No really, almost anything.)
  It's way more satisfying when I can do it with like-minded cool people, though.
  If that might be you, hit me up!
</p>
<p>
  I'm conversant in Spanish, and speak a <em>little</em> bit of German, but I
  don't get many chances to practice and I've never managed to stick it through
  with Duolingo, so if you know of a more immersive (or less naggy) way to keep
  the rust off, I'd also love to hear about it.
</p>
<p>
  My hobbies include headphones, comics, food, fiction (SFF), and philosophy.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The headphone collection is now more than a dozen items (I ended up with a
    duplicate or two, for what it's worth.) I should really put some of these
    suckers on Audiogon/craigslist/eBay or SOMETHING, but if you want a demo...
  </li>
  <li>
    Toward the start of the pandemic I got in on the Kickstarter for the comic
    <a href="https://ohumanstar.com/">O Human Star</a> so now I've got a sweet
    three-volume physical copy!
  </li>
  <li>
    Some favorite authors: Margaret Atwood, Jorge Luis Borges, William Gibson,
    Charles Stross. I finally read Jeff VanderMeer's <i>Annihilation</i> after
    several years (and after watching the movie&mdash;if you're gonna do both,
    do it in that order, simply because the book is better and I doubt they'll
    make films for the rest of the trilogy. :P) I might pick up <i>The Long Way
    to a Small Angry Planet</i> next, cus my friends keep mentioning it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although, before getting to that, I've also picked up some NON-fiction:
    David Graeber's <i>Debt: The First 5000 Years</i>. I really can't recommend
    it highly enough, it's a perspective-shifter. Accepting recommendations for
    other political anthropology/philosophy or philosophy of mind, or anything
    that goes as hard as GEB.
  </li>
  <li>
    I make art sometimes! Not very much of it is online (and if you do manage to
    find some online, it won't be from this decade) but I might be changing that
    at some point soonish. A little bit of it is featured on this tab, anyway.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can contact me at <b><code>reysquared(at)gmail(dot)com</code></b> if you
  aren't a robot. (If you are a robot, I probably can't stop you from contacting
  me, but my replies will not be as prompt. Sorry.)

            <h2>Personal and Academic Projects</h2>
<div class="customrule"></div>
<p>
  The purpose of this tab is to highlight projects that are either currently
  available online, OR that I have plans to make available... "eventually."
  So, more things will become visible here overtime. You can take a look at my
  <a href="https://github.com/reysquared">GitHub page</a>, but it's a little
  more sparse than I'd like&mdash;a lot of the repos I've worked on happen to
  be private. I'm working on it, though. Until then, you can check out...
</p>
<h3>Personal Projects:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/caesarsolver.html">Caesar Cipher Solver</a></li>
  <li><a href="/mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot Fractal Visualizer</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Student Projects:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/zsweedyk/CS121F14S3_Team2">Fraction Blaster</a> &mdash; an iPad
    game for elementary school students <i>in spaaace!</i> Developed by Louis Brann, Kevin Choi,
    Alejandro Mendoza, and of course myself. <del>Now available for free on the App Store!</del>
    <em>Formerly</em> available on the App Store, I think it got taken down whenever the Apple
    Developer Program account expired. (HMC paid the original $99/year for it, I'm not interested!)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/reysquared/CS121-sudoku">A sudoku app</a> &mdash;
    for the Harvey Mudd CSCI121 Software Development course. Includes an auto-solve
    function and a decent number of pre-generated puzzles at two difficulty levels
    for increased replayability. NOT available on the App Store though ;-)
  </li>
  <li>
    The C proxy that will never let you down &mdash; a project for CS105 that injects Rick
    Astley's &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up&rdquo; into every page you load... because we're bad people.
    Developed by me and Chris Brown. (Link forthcoming)
  </li>
  <li>
    Implementation of a segmented prime sieve and analysis of its memory performance
    (Needs to be made web-friendly, but I'm like 95% sure I still have both all the
    source code and the LaTeX writeup kicking around somewhere in my backups)
  </li>
  <li class="top-gap">...More and even older things that I'll add here eventually</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scraps:</h3>
<p>...that are <b>already online</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/reysquared/video-note">video-note</a> &mdash; An
    HTML5 canvas app for making and saving ink annotations on videos! Was under
    development as a student, but stalled when I realized there were some bugs
    with the interval-tree library I was using. I'll get back to it sometime if
    I ever have a chance to figure out what's causing them and write a PR... or
    if I just end up making my own itree implementation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/scraps/topoapp/topoapp.html">topoapp.html</a> &mdash; A brief foray into
    geographic visualization with d3 and TopoJSON. Fair warning: REALLY ugly and
    janky. Still, the research/data processing parts of it were kinda fun.
  </li>
  <li><a href="/scraps/asciiseal.txt">asciiseal.txt</a> &mdash; Text Mode Improper Use</li>
  </ul>
<p>... that are <b>coming soon</b> to a screen near you:</p>
<p>Numerous small JavaScript utilities (useful stuff) and dealies (fun stuff; technical term).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Markov (de)generator nonsense</li>
  <li>Puzzle-solving helpers</li>
  <li>JSON visualizer, because sometimes it's cathartic to reinvent the wheel</li>
  <li>Probably other stuff?</li>
</ul>

            <h2>About This Webpage</h2>
<div class="customrule"></div>
<p>
  This website started out as a demo project page for Harvey Mudd's intro CS class.
  They are (were?) starting to integrate web technologies into the course as an
  extra credit project, and Prof. Dodds thought it would be really cool if students
  had individual portals they could update as they go along to show off the things
  they made throughout the course while learning about a web stack at the same time.
  So one summer while I was on Student CS Staff, I took a couple weeks to take a
  crack at a prototype (after brushing up on my semantic HTML)!
</p>
<p>
  Initially it was hosted for a brief time on Amazon Web Services, and then for
  several years after that on the Harvey Mudd CS department server, under my
  <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~kmcswiggen/">student webspace</a>. I'll
  probably just make that redirect to this page at some point, I dunno... but
  for now you can see a version of this site that's more than a half decade old!
  Don't judge it too harshly, my standards have improved since I was a student.
</p>
<p>
  Originally done entirely in vanilla JavaScript, and with the frontend code
  almost entirely inside a single gigantic IIFE, it's now <strong>implemented chiefly
  in React and built using webpack</strong>, and the full source is available on GitHub.
  The couple of Python CGI scripts it had, which were originally placeholders
  to be replaced by CS5 students' own work, have mostly already been ported into
  JavaScript (since it's a bit easier to host and zero effort to configure) and
  expanded on, and will continue to appear on the Projects tab as they're
  completed&mdash;probably even as separate git submodules! ... Eventually.

  Congrats, you curious monkey, you checked the source. There's a comment like
  this one on all the major pages, so now you can read my discreet list of...

  *** POSSIBLE FUTURE TODOS FOR THIS PAGE ***

  - first of all, need to do WAY more accessibility testing still, I can't lie
  - organize subpages into directories and rename other html src files to index.html
  - add actual automated tests for my React components lmfao (especially CoordinateWindowPicker)
  - convert more class components into functions, I was reading older tutorials
    when I started this project :P learning by doing!
  - get a more fully-featured templating engine?  ...ehhh, maybe when I can
    actually do server-side rendering, probably not for GitHub Pages tbh
  - figure out a solution for displaying more tabs at smaller resolutions (scrollable list?)
  - enable webpack tree-shaking, install webpack-merge and split up my config
    into .common.js, .dev.js and .prod.js files. too much happening in my package.json
    scripts at the moment lol.
  - Take a stab at getting Markov stuff into JavaScript and online!
