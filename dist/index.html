My pronouns are they/them. I'm a computer scientist, software engineer, and web developer&mdash;three closely-related but distinct hats. I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in Spring 2016 and since then have been living in the Bay Area with my partner (now spouse!) </p> <p> I like doing code-y stuff of pretty much any kind. (No really, almost anything.) It's way more satisfying when I can do it with like-minded cool people, though. If that might be you, hit me up! </p> <p> I'm conversant in Spanish, and speak a <em>little</em> bit of German, but I don't get many chances to practice and I've never managed to stick it through with Duolingo, so if you know of a more immersive (or less naggy) way to keep the rust off, I'd also love to hear about it. </p> <p> My hobbies include headphones, comics, food, fiction (SFF), and philosophy. </p> <ul> <li> The headphone collection is now more than a dozen items (I ended up with a duplicate or two, for what it's worth.) I should really put some of these suckers on Audiogon/craigslist/eBay or SOMETHING, but if you want a demo... </li> <li> Toward the start of the pandemic I got in on the Kickstarter for the comic <a href="https://ohumanstar.com/">O Human Star</a> so now I've got a sweet three-volume physical copy! </li> <li> Some favorite authors: Margaret Atwood, Jorge Luis Borges, William Gibson, Charles Stross. I finally read Jeff VanderMeer's <i>Annihilation</i> after several years (and after watching the movie&mdash;if you're gonna do both, do it in that order, simply because the book is better and I doubt they'll make films for the rest of the trilogy. :P) I might pick up <i>The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet</i> next, cus my friends keep mentioning it. </li> <li> Although, before getting to that, I've also picked up some NON-fiction: David Graeber's <i>Debt: The First 5000 Years</i>. I really can't recommend it highly enough, it's a perspective-shifter. Accepting recommendations for other political anthropology/philosophy or philosophy of mind, or anything that goes as hard as GEB. </li> <li> I make art sometimes! Not very much of it is online (and if you do manage to find some online, it won't be from this decade) but I might be changing that at some point soonish. A little bit of it is featured on this tab, anyway. </li> </ul> <p> You can contact me at <b><code>reysquared(at)gmail(dot)com</code></b> if you aren't a robot. (If you are a robot, I probably can't stop you from contacting me, but my replies will not be as prompt. Sorry.) </p> <a class="button go-back" href="#top">Main</a> </section> <section id="resume" class="content"> <h2>Résumé</h2> <div class="customrule"></div> <p><strong>OVERVIEW:</strong></p> <p> <strong>Programming Languages:</strong> proficient with C++, C&#9839;, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Python; knowledgeable in Haskell, Java, Objective-C; familiarity working with Prolog, Racket, x86 assembly </p> <p> <strong>Development Experience:</strong> working with a team on a year-long project as part of clinic; web design using HTML5 semantics; small and medium-scale program design and development; writing and refactoring code for performance; complex data structure use and implementation; debugging at source and assembly level </p> <p> <strong>Software:</strong> Windows, OSX, Linux (Ubuntu/Gentoo); Visual Studio; Office Suite; LaTeX; Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash (no, really!); GIMP </p> <hr> <p><strong>EDUCATION:</strong></p> <p> <strong>HARVEY MUDD COLLEGE, Claremont, CA</strong><br> B.S.

"eventually." So, more things will become visible here overtime. You can take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/reysquared">GitHub page</a>, but it's a little more sparse than I'd like&mdash;a lot of the repos I've worked on happen to be private. I'm working on it, though. Until then, you can check out... </p> <h3>Personal Projects:</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/caesarsolver.html">Caesar Cipher Solver</a></li> <li><a href="/mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot Fractal Visualizer</a></li> </ul> <h3>Student Projects:</h3> <ul> <li> <a href="https://github.com/zsweedyk/CS121F14S3_Team2">Fraction Blaster</a> &mdash; an iPad game for elementary school students <i>in spaaace!</i> Developed by Louis Brann, Kevin Choi, Alejandro Mendoza, and of course myself. <del>Now available for free on the App Store!</del> <em>Formerly</em> available on the App Store, I think it got taken down whenever the Apple Developer Program account expired. (HMC paid the original $99/year for it, I'm not interested!) </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/reysquared/CS121-sudoku">A sudoku app</a> &mdash; for the Harvey Mudd CSCI121 Software Development course. Includes an auto-solve function and a decent number of pre-generated puzzles at two difficulty levels for increased replayability. NOT available on the App Store though ;-) </li> <li> The C proxy that will never let you down &mdash; a project for CS105 that injects Rick Astley's &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up&rdquo; into every page you load... because we're bad people. Developed by me and Chris Brown. (Link forthcoming) </li> <li> Implementation of a segmented prime sieve and analysis of its memory performance (Needs to be made web-friendly, but I'm like 95% sure I still have both all the source code and the LaTeX writeup kicking around somewhere in my backups) </li> <li class="top-gap">...More and even older things that I'll add here eventually</li> </ul> <h3>Scraps:</h3> <p>...that are <b>already online</b>:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://github.com/reysquared/video-note">video-note</a> &mdash; An HTML5 canvas app for making and saving ink annotations on videos! Was under development as a student, but stalled when I realized there were some bugs with the interval-tree library I was using. I'll get back to it sometime if I ever have a chance to figure out what's causing them and write a PR... or if I just end up making my own itree implementation. </li> <li> <a href="/scraps/topoapp/topoapp.html">topoapp.html</a> &mdash; A brief foray into geographic visualization with d3 and TopoJSON. Fair warning: REALLY ugly and janky.

They are (were?) starting to integrate web technologies into the course as an extra credit project, and Prof. Dodds thought it would be really cool if students had individual portals they could update as they go along to show off the things they made throughout the course while learning about a web stack at the same time. So one summer while I was on Student CS Staff, I took a couple weeks to take a crack at a prototype (after brushing up on my semantic HTML)! </p> <p> Initially it was hosted for a brief time on Amazon Web Services, and then for several years after that on the Harvey Mudd CS department server, under my <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~kmcswiggen/">student webspace</a>. I'll probably just make that redirect to this page at some point, I dunno... but for now you can see a version of this site that's more than a half decade old! Don't judge it too harshly, my standards have improved since I was a student. </p> <p> Originally done entirely in vanilla JavaScript, and with the frontend code almost entirely inside a single gigantic IIFE, it's now <strong>implemented chiefly in React and built using webpack</strong>, and the full source is available on GitHub. The couple of Python CGI scripts it had, which were originally placeholders to be replaced by CS5 students' own work, have mostly already been ported into JavaScript (since it's a bit easier to host and zero effort to configure) and expanded on, and will continue to appear on the Projects tab as they're completed&mdash;probably even as separate git submodules! ... Eventually. </p> <a class="button go-back" href="#top">Main</a> </section> </div> </noscript> </div> <footer id="sticky-footer"> <div> &copy; 2022 Kevin McSwiggen<br><br> <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"> <img src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" alt="Valid CSS!"> </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"> <img src="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/badge/html5-badge-h-css3-semantics.png" alt="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling, and Semantics" title="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling, and Semantics"> </a> </div> <div id="theme-toggle-container"></div> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
