  You're telling me I can write whatever I want here? Like, <em>anything?</em> Wow. All this

<p>
  Hello, the name's Kevin McSwiggen! My pronouns are they/them (or occasionally
  he/him around older relatives.) I'm a computer scientist, software engineer,
  and web developer--three closely-related but distinct hats. I graduated from
  Harvey Mudd College in Spring 2016 and since then have been living in the Bay
  Area with my partner (now spouse!)
</p>
<p>
  I like doing code-y stuff of pretty much any kind. (No really, almost anything.)
  It's way more satisfying when I can do it with like-minded cool people, though.
  If that might be you, hit me up!
</p>
<p>
  I'm conversant in Spanish, and speak a <em>little</em> bit of German, but I
  don't get many chances to practice and I've never managed to stick it through
  with Duolingo, so if you know of a more immersive (or less naggy) way to keep
  the rust off, I'd also love to hear about it.
</p>
<p>
  My hobbies include headphones, comics, food, fiction (SFF), and internet.
  <ul>
    <li>
      The headphone collection is now more than a dozen items (I ended up with a
      duplicate or two, for what it's worth.) I really gotta put some of these
      suckers on Audiogon/craigslist/eBay, or SOMETHING.
    </li>
    <li>
      Toward the start of the pandemic I got in on the Kickstarter for the comic
      <a href="https://ohumanstar.com/">O Human Star</a> so now I've got a sweet
      three-volume physical copy!
    </li>
    <li>
      Some favorite authors: Margaret Atwood, Jorge Luis Borges, William Gibson,
      Charles Stross. I finally read Jeff VanderMeer's <i>Annihilation</i> after
      several years (and after watching the movie--if you're gonna do both, do
      it in that order, simply because the book is better. :P) The rest of the
      trilogy is next when I get some time, unless my friends convince me to
      pick up <i>The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet</i> first.
    </li>
    <li>
      Although, before getting to that, I've also picked up some NON-fiction: I
      started reading David Graeber's <i>Debt: The First 5000 Years</i>. Already
      I can't recommend it enough, it <em>will</em> change your perspective.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  You can contact me at <b><code>reysquared(at)gmail(dot)com</code></b> if you
  aren't a robot. (If you are a robot, I probably can't stop you from contacting
  me, but my replies will not be as prompt. Sorry.)

  You can check out <a href="https://github.com/reysquared">my GitHub page</a>, but it's

<p><b>Past Projects</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/zsweedyk/CS121F14S3_Team2">Fraction Blaster</a> &ndash; an iPad
    game for elementary school students <i>in spaaace!</i> Developed by Louis Brann, Kevin Choi,
    Alejandro Mendoza, and of course myself. Now available for free on the app store!
  </li>
  <li>
    The C proxy that will never let you down &ndash; a project for CS105 that injects Rick
    Astley's &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up&rdquo; into every page you load, because we're bad people.
    Developed by me and Chris Brown. (Link forthcoming)
  </li>
  <li>More/older things that I'll add here eventually</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Scraps</b> which I already have online:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="asciiseal.txt">asciiseal.txt</a> &ndash; Text Mode Improper Use</li>
  <li><a href="topoapp/topoapp.html">topoapp.html</a> &ndash; A brief foray into geographic visualization with d3 and
    TopoJSON</li>

<p><b>Coming Soon</b> to <s>a webpage near you</s> right here:
<ul>
  <li>An HTML5 app for making and saving ink annotations on videos! (Under development)</li>
  <li>Implementation and analysis of a segmented prime sieve (Needs to be made web-friendly)</li>
  <li>
    At some point I'm gonna look into fixing the brief display issues when this page first
    loads. It's intended to be accessible even if you have JavaScript disabled, but this makes
    it look less good for people who DON'T have it disabled, if only for a brief moment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Numerous small JavaScript utilities (useful stuff) and dealies (fun stuff; technical term).
    <ul>
      <li>Markov-generated sin</li>
      <li>Ken-ken helper</li>
      <li>JSON visualizer, because sometimes it's cathartic to reinvent the wheel</li>

  <li>Probably more?</li>

            <h2>About This Webpage</h2>
<div class="customrule"></div>
<p>
  This website started out as a demo project page for Harvey Mudd's intro CS class.
  They are (were?) starting to integrate web technologies into the course as an
  extra credit project, and Prof. Dodds thought it would be really cool if students
  had individual portals they could update as they go along to show off the things
  they made throughout the course while learning about a web stack at the same time.
  So one summer while I was on Student CS Staff, I took a crack at a prototype!
</p>
<p>
  Initially it was hosted for a brief time on Amazon Web Services, and then for
  several years after that on the HMC Computer Science department server, under
  my <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~kmcswiggen/">student webspace</a>. I'll
  probably just make that redirect to this page at some point, I dunno... but
  for now you can see a version of this site that's more than a half decade old!
  Don't judge it too harshly, my standards have improved since I was in college.
</p>
<p>
  Originally done entirely in vanilla JavaScript, and with the frontend code
  contained almost entirely inside a single IIFE, it's now implemented chiefly
  in React and built using webpack, and the full source is available on GitHub.
  The couple of Python CGI scripts it had, which were originally placeholders
  to be replaced by CS5 students' own work, are in the process of being ported
  into JavaScript (since it's a bit easier to host and zero effort to configure)
  and will appear on the Projects tab as they're completed, probably as separate
  git submodules.
