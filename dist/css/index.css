/*
 * Not all browsers support CSS custom properties still, hence this mixin. It
 * actually provides a fallback in two different ways. The first is the initial
 * declaration, to handle browsers that don't support var() in which case the
 * latter will be ignored entirely. However, for browsers that DO support it,
 * the custom property value is determined at runtime, so if it is invalid or
 * unset in that context, the first declaration will already have been discarded
 * and the value will become unset. Hence the second fallback, within the var()
 * itself, which is ONLY useful in browsers that support the feature.
