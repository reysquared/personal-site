          This is a simple encrypter/decrypter for an English-alphabet 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>
          (or "shift cipher") which transforms a piece of text by "rotating" all
          the alphabetic characters to a different position in the alphabet by a
          particular offset amount. (The tool ignores any non-alpha characters.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Since decryption is performed by the same operation as encryption but
          with a different offset, you can click the "Invert" button to quickly
          swap to the mod-26 complement of the current rotation value.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you THINK you have a Caesar ciphertext but you aren't sure, or know
          that you have one but you aren't sure what the offset is, you can
          hit the Auto-Decipher button. This determines the output for every
          possible rotation value and, using monogram frequencies for English
          text, applies the offset it considers the most likely to produce an
          English string.
