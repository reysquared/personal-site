<h2>About This Webpage</h2>
<div class="customrule"></div>
<p>
  I originally designed and coded this site as a demo project page for Harvey Mudd's intro
  CS class. They are (were?) starting to integrate web technologies into the course as extra credit,
  and Professor Dodds thought it would be really cool if the students had individual project
  pages that they could update as they go along, both to take advantage of the new things
  that they learn about the web, and to interactively show off some of the scripts they make
  for the class.

<p>
  This started out as something like a prototype. I tried as much as possible to make the look
  both clean and classy, showing off all kinds of little details with CSS and such as kind of a
  teaching page. I decided to do the whole thing in bog-standard JavaScript also, in part as a
  demonstration and in part because using all of JQuery seemed like overkill for such a tiny
  page, you know? (The experience was a little bit zen. More people should use plain JS.)

  Of course, it looked slightly different at that point. The old version is enshrined
  <a href="#deleted">here</a> for personal posterity, complete with boatloads of comments
  all over the source, so curious students could more easily pick apart the page. Pardon the
  kind of nonsense content&mdash;I wasn't responsible for designing the curriculum track, just
  the webpage, so the text is mostly stupid garbage intended to fill the space. Some of the
  technical information in the body text is also kind of meta and maybe inaccurate so ignore
  that junk too. (The comments are still pretty good, though.)

  The most important part of it, arguably, were the forms that could be used to interact with
  server-side Python scripts (which would hypothetically be written by the students.) Though mostly
  not super-involved, they would serve as templates for students curious about server interaction
  and HTTP. Those are also still accessible below, for two different scripts and with two versions
  (of differing input complexity) for each. If you try out the Mandelbrot generator, make sure you
  turn off your pop-up blocker!
