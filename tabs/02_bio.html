  Hello, I'm Kevin! I'm a computer science major from Harvey Mudd College
  who graduated in Spring 2016 and is now conquering the real world.
</p>
<p>
  I like doing code-y stuff of pretty much any kind. (No, really, almost anything.)
</p>
<p>Hobbies include headphones, cooking, and internet.</p>
<p>

  You can contact me at <code>reysquared (at) gmail.com</code> if you aren't
  a robot. (If you are a robot, I probably can't stop you from contacting
  me, but my replies will not be as prompt. Sorry.)
