Many years and a degree hence, I've reworked it to use Caman (mostly because of the portmanteau, let's be real) to manipulate a canvas element directly, so it can run entirely on the client-side. In addition to a Mandelbrot visualizer, it now also has a second canvas that lets you explore the Julia sets for <var>z<sup>2</sup></var>. </p> <h3>Controls</h3> <p> Along with the visible and expandable form inputs, you can interact with the main canvas rendering the Mandelbrot set, by: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>clicking,</strong> to render the Julia set for <var>z<sup>2</sup></var> + <var>c</var>, where c is the point you clicked on in the currently selected viewing window; </li> <li> <strong>double-clicking,</strong> to zoom in 2x on the selected point; </li> <li> <strong>right-click dragging,</strong> to zoom the viewing window in to the specific selected area. </li> </ul> <p> <strong>NOTE</strong> that when drag-zooming the fractal WILL render to the specific newly-selected area, but the canvas will NOT be resized, to avoid moving the page content and possibly creating absurd aspect ratios. For the moment this means the region will get squished to fit the current canvas aspect ratio. If you'd prefer a <em>well-scaled</em> Mandelbrot at the same zoom level, the viewing window input does update to respect the canvas aspect ratio, so you can just hit the "Render Fractal" button again. I'm still waffling on how I want to approach fixing this, but I also kinda like the goofy behavior :) </p> <h3>The Math</h3> <p> Coming soon...! But if you're in a hurry and don't mind reading math you can also check out the Wikipedia article about the Julia set <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set#Quadratic_polynomials">here</a>, particularly the section "Quadratic polynomials". </p> </section> </div> </div> <footer id="sticky-footer"> <div> &copy; 2022 Kevin McSwiggen<br><br> <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"> <img src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" alt="Valid CSS!"> </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"> <img src="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/badge/html5-badge-h-css3-semantics.png" alt="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling, and Semantics" title="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling, and Semantics"> </a> </div> <div id="theme-toggle-container"></div> </footer> </div> </body> <!--
  Congrats, you curious monkey, you checked the source. There's a comment like
  this one on all the major pages, so now you can read my discreet list of...

  *** POSSIBLE FUTURE TODOS FOR THIS PAGE ***

  - Convert into a separate git submodule
  - Switch to a different canvas rendering library?
  - Or at least stop relying on the CDN version of Caman lol
  - Allow setting background images?
    - Already using Caman, so background and filter layer could just be fully
      independent. Just color points in the set as rgba(0,0,0,0) instead of
      passing a bgColor and then flatten downward!
  - Add some kind of orbit trap mode to FractalColorModeSelect probably
  - Add an explanation of some of the math to the page!
  - I'm pretty sure I can make the aspect ratio resolution more efficient. I
    mean... SURELY, right? (See comments in maintainRangeAspectRatios)
  - Right-click-drag rectangle has an awful tendency to stutter, sup with that
  - Solve the problem with drag-zoom not respecting aspect ratios... eventually.
