// TODO|kevin okay well, THIS is honestly mostly aspirational. BUT...

// What sort of things would we want in a markov library?
/*
TOKENIZE interface
  should accept options for what kind of tokens to generate lol
  i.e. word or ngram based?
  should also accept an ORDER int, probably? 
which of course should produce some kind of standardized TOKENS dict(?)
it should be possible to MERGE parsed tokens dicts into a single data source ideally
if that turns out to be too much of a pain, API should at least enable reading in multiple sources
(possibly with the option to weight different sources?)
