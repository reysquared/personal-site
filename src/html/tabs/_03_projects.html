<h2>Personal and Academic Projects</h2>
<div class="customrule"></div>
<p>
  The purpose of this tab is to highlight projects that are either currently
  available online, OR that I have plans to make available... "eventually."
  So, more things will become visible here overtime. You can take a look at my
  <a href="https://github.com/reysquared">GitHub page</a>, but it's a little
  more sparse than I'd like&mdash;a lot of the repos I've worked on happen to
  be private. I'm working on it, though. Until then, you can check out...
</p>
<h3>Personal Projects:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/caesarsolver.html">Caesar Cipher Solver</a></li>
  <li><a href="/mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot Fractal Visualizer</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Student Projects:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/zsweedyk/CS121F14S3_Team2">Fraction Blaster</a> &mdash; an iPad
    game for elementary school students <i>in spaaace!</i> Developed by Louis Brann, Kevin Choi,
    Alejandro Mendoza, and of course myself. <del>Now available for free on the App Store!</del>
    <em>Formerly</em> available on the App Store, I think it got taken down whenever the Apple
    Developer Program account expired. (HMC paid the original $99/year for it, I'm not interested!)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/reysquared/CS121-sudoku">A sudoku app</a> &mdash;
    for the Harvey Mudd CSCI121 Software Development course. Includes an auto-solve
    function and a decent number of pre-generated puzzles at two difficulty levels
    for increased replayability. NOT available on the App Store though ;-)
  </li>
  <li>
    The C proxy that will never let you down &mdash; a project for CS105 that injects Rick
    Astley's &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up&rdquo; into every page you load... because we're bad people.
    Developed by me and Chris Brown. (Link forthcoming)
  </li>
  <li>
    Implementation of a segmented prime sieve and analysis of its memory performance
    (Needs to be made web-friendly, but I'm like 95% sure I still have both all the
    source code and the LaTeX writeup kicking around somewhere in my backups)
  </li>
  <li class="top-gap">...More and even older things that I'll add here eventually</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scraps:</h3>
<p>...that are <b>already online</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/reysquared/video-note">video-note</a> &mdash; An
    HTML5 canvas app for making and saving ink annotations on videos! Was under
    development as a student, but stalled when I realized there were some bugs
    with the interval-tree library I was using. I'll get back to it sometime if
    I ever have a chance to figure out what's causing them and write a PR... or
    if I just end up making my own itree implementation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/scraps/topoapp/topoapp.html">topoapp.html</a> &mdash; A brief foray into
    geographic visualization with d3 and TopoJSON. Fair warning: REALLY ugly and
    janky. Still, the research/data processing parts of it were kinda fun.
  </li>
  <li><a href="/scraps/asciiseal.txt">asciiseal.txt</a> &mdash; Text Mode Improper Use</li>
  </ul>
<p>... that are <b>coming soon</b> to a screen near you:</p>
<p>Numerous small JavaScript utilities (useful stuff) and dealies (fun stuff; technical term).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Markov (de)generator nonsense</li>
  <li>Puzzle-solving helpers</li>
  <li>JSON visualizer, because sometimes it's cathartic to reinvent the wheel</li>
  <li>Probably other stuff?</li>
</ul>
