<!-- TODO|kevin I should make this tab specifically for projects that are ON THIS SITE. or at least have a link?
Then the resume tab can link to them on this tab or whatever. -->
<p>
  You can check out <a href="https://github.com/reysquared">my GitHub page</a>, but it's
  kind of empty right now. (Most of my repos happen to be private...) I'm working on it.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Past Projects</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/zsweedyk/CS121F14S3_Team2">Fraction Blaster</a> &ndash; an iPad
    game for elementary school students <i>in spaaace!</i> Developed by Louis Brann, Kevin Choi,
    Alejandro Mendoza, and of course myself. Now available for free on the app store!
  </li>
  <li>
    The C proxy that will never let you down &ndash; a project for CS105 that injects Rick
    Astley's &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up&rdquo; into every page you load, because we're bad people.
    Developed by me and Chris Brown. (Link forthcoming)
  </li>
  <li>More/older things that I'll add here eventually</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Scraps</b> which I already have online:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="asciiseal.txt">asciiseal.txt</a> &ndash; Text Mode Improper Use</li>
  <li><a href="topoapp/topoapp.html">topoapp.html</a> &ndash; A brief foray into geographic visualization with d3 and

  <li>Implementation and analysis of a segmented prime sieve (Needs to be made web-friendly)</li>
  <li>
    At some point I'm gonna look into fixing the brief display issues when this page first
    loads. It's intended to be accessible even if you have JavaScript disabled, but this makes
    it look less good for people who DON'T have it disabled, if only for a brief moment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Numerous small JavaScript utilities (useful stuff) and dealies (fun stuff; technical term).
    <ul>
      <li>Markov-generated sin</li>
      <li>Ken-ken helper</li>
      <li>JSON visualizer, because sometimes it's cathartic to reinvent the wheel</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Probably more?</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO|kevin dumping some links to the "old" projects here lol -->
<p>Former Python CGI scripts ported to JavaScript:</p>
