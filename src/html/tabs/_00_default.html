  You're telling me I can write whatever I want here? Like, <em>anything?</em> Wow.
  All this power is kind of humbling. Maybe I should step away from the keyboard.

<p><b>News:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Got married, got a house, aaand... got laid off? All in the same six months. That's an eventful half-year!</li>
  <li>Wow, this pandemic is still going, huh.</li>
  <li><em>Finally</em> updating my website for the first time in ages, check it out:
    <ul>
      <li>Migrated from the Harvey Mudd CS department server to Github Pages</li>
      <li>Re-implemented the entire interface in React (the main webpage still supports noscript though!) over the course of ~2 days</li>
      <li>Added a dark theme option</li>
      <li>Ported some of my ancient, broken Python 2 CGI scripts into new, functioning JavaScript so they can also work on Pages</li>
      <li>Updated the info on here too, obviously</li>
      <li>Did my best to make the interactive elements WAI-ARIA compliant. If you notice any defficiencies, please let me know!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <!-- maybe switch up the music rec!!! -->
  <li>Making plans to go camping with some friends this July. It'll be the first time in a while!</li>
  <li>I'm a little past 70% in Breath of the Wild now, and second-guessing my choice to go to 100%.</li>
  <li>
    I don't have music recs from this year yet, but listen to Daisuke Tanabe's
    <a href="https://daisuketanabe.bandcamp.com/album/cat-steps">Cat Steps</a>.
