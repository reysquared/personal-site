  Hello, the name's Kevin McSwiggen! My pronouns are they/them. <!-- (or occasionally
  he/him around older relatives.) --> I'm a computer scientist, software engineer,
  and web developer&mdash;three closely-related but distinct hats. I graduated
  from Harvey Mudd College in Spring 2016 and since then have been living in the
  Bay Area with my partner (now spouse!)
</p>
<p>
  I like doing code-y stuff of pretty much any kind. (No really, almost anything.)
  It's way more satisfying when I can do it with like-minded cool people, though.
  If that might be you, hit me up!
</p>
<p>
  I'm conversant in Spanish, and speak a <em>little</em> bit of German, although
  I should really find more excuses to practice.
</p>
<p>
  My hobbies include headphones, comics, food, fiction (SFF), film, and philosophy.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The headphone collection is now more than a dozen items (I ended up with a
    duplicate or two, for what it's worth.) I should really put some of these
    suckers on Audiogon/craigslist/eBay or SOMETHING, but if you want a demo...
  </li>
  <li>
    Toward the start of the pandemic I got in on the Kickstarter for the comic
    <a href="https://ohumanstar.com/">O Human Star</a> so now I've got a sweet
    three-volume physical copy!
  </li>
  <li>
    Some favorite authors: Margaret Atwood, Jorge Luis Borges, William Gibson,
    Charles Stross. I finally read Jeff VanderMeer's <i>Annihilation</i> after
    several years (and after watching the movie&mdash;if you're gonna do both,
    do it in that order, simply because the book is better and I doubt they'll
    make films for the rest of the trilogy. :P) I might pick up <i>The Long Way
    to a Small Angry Planet</i> next, cus my friends keep mentioning it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although, before getting to that, I've also picked up some NON-fiction:
    David Graeber's <i>Debt: The First 5000 Years</i>. I really can't recommend
    it highly enough, it's a perspective-shifter. Accepting recommendations for
    other political anthropology/philosophy or philosophy of mind, or anything
    that goes as hard as GEB.
  </li>
  <li>
    I make art sometimes! Not very much of it is online (and if you do manage to
    find some online, it won't be from this decade) but I might be changing that
    at some point soonish. A little bit of it is featured on this tab, anyway.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recently watched Sion Sono's 2013 <em>Why Don't You Play in Hell</em> and am
    once again convinced that he is basically incapable of making a dud, no matter
    how insane it may be.
  </li>
</ul>

  contacting me, but my replies will not be as prompt. Sorry.)
