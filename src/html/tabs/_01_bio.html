  Hello, the name's Kevin McSwiggen! My pronouns are they/them. <!-- (or occasionally
  he/him around older relatives.) --> I'm a computer scientist, software engineer,
  and web developer&mdash;three closely-related but distinct hats. I graduated
  from Harvey Mudd College in Spring 2016 and since then have been living in the
  Bay Area with my partner (now spouse!)
</p>
<p>
  I like doing code-y stuff of pretty much any kind. (No really, almost anything.)
  It's way more satisfying when I can do it with like-minded cool people, though.
  If that might be you, hit me up!
</p>
<p>
  I'm conversant in Spanish, and speak a <em>little</em> bit of German, but I
  don't get many chances to practice and I've never managed to stick it through
  with Duolingo, so if you know of a more immersive (or less naggy) way to keep
  the rust off, I'd also love to hear about it.
</p>
<p>
  My hobbies include headphones, comics, food, fiction (SFF), and internet.
  <!-- TODO|kevin hey, I should mention Philosophy of Mind somewhere on here! -->
  <!-- Other things that might be cool to mention (along with perhaps slightly)
  shrinking what I already have here lol) -- art? puzzles? Project Euler? (do I
  still have an account on that?) -->
  <ul>
    <li>
      The headphone collection is now more than a dozen items (I ended up with a
      duplicate or two, for what it's worth.) I really gotta put some of these
      suckers on Audiogon/craigslist/eBay, or SOMETHING.
    </li>
    <li>
      Toward the start of the pandemic I got in on the Kickstarter for the comic
      <a href="https://ohumanstar.com/">O Human Star</a> so now I've got a sweet
      three-volume physical copy!
    </li>
    <li>
      Some favorite authors: Margaret Atwood, Jorge Luis Borges, William Gibson,
      Charles Stross. I finally read Jeff VanderMeer's <i>Annihilation</i> after
      several years (and after watching the movie&mdash;if you're gonna do both,
      do it in that order, simply because the book is better. :P) The rest of
      the trilogy is next when I get some time, unless my friends convince me to
      pick up <i>The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet</i> first.
    </li>
    <li>
      Although, before getting to that, I've also picked up some NON-fiction: I
      started reading David Graeber's <i>Debt: The First 5000 Years</i>. Already
      I can't recommend it enough, it <em>will</em> change your perspective.
    </li>
  </ul>

  You can contact me at <b><code>reysquared(at)gmail(dot)com</code></b> if you
  aren't a robot. (If you are a robot, I probably can't stop you from contacting
  me, but my replies will not be as prompt. Sorry.)
