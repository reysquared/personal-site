<h2>About This Webpage</h2>
<div class="customrule"></div>
<p>
  This website started out as a demo project page for Harvey Mudd's intro CS class.
  They are (were?) starting to integrate web technologies into the course as an
  extra credit project, and Prof. Dodds thought it would be really cool if students
  had individual portals they could update as they go along to show off the things
  they made throughout the course while learning about a web stack at the same time.
  So one summer while I was on Student CS Staff, I took a crack at a prototype!

  Initially it was hosted for a brief time on Amazon Web Services, and then for
  several years after that on the HMC Computer Science department server, under
  my <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~kmcswiggen/">student webspace</a>. I'll
  probably just make that redirect to this page at some point, I dunno... but
  for now you can see a version of this site that's more than a half decade old!
  Don't judge it too harshly, my standards have improved since I was in college.

  Originally done entirely in vanilla JavaScript, and with the frontend code
  contained almost entirely inside a single IIFE, it's now implemented chiefly
  in React and built using webpack, and the full source is available on GitHub.
  The couple of Python CGI scripts it had, which were originally placeholders
  to be replaced by CS5 students' own work, are in the process of being ported
  into JavaScript (since it's a bit easier to host and zero effort to configure)
  and will appear on the Projects tab as they're completed, probably as separate
  git submodules.
