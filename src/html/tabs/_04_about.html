<h2>About This Webpage</h2>
<div class="customrule"></div>
<p>
  Originally done entirely in vanilla JavaScript, and with the frontend code almost
  entirely inside a single gigantic IIFE, this site is now <strong>implemented
  chiefly in React and built using webpack</strong>, and the full source is
  available on <a href="https://github.com/reysquared/personal-site">GitHub</a>.

  This webpage started out as a demo project page for Harvey Mudd's intro CS class.
  They are (were?) starting to integrate web technologies into the course as an
  extra credit project, and Prof. Dodds thought it would be really cool if students
  had individual portals they could update as they go along to show off the things
  they made throughout the course while learning about a web stack at the same time.
  So one summer while I was on Student CS Staff, I took a couple weeks to take a
  crack at a prototype (after brushing up on my semantic HTML)!

<p>
  Initially it was hosted for a brief time on Amazon Web Services, and then for
  several years after that on the Harvey Mudd CS department server, under my
  <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~kmcswiggen/">student webspace</a>. I'll
  probably just make that redirect to this page at some point, I dunno... but
  for now you can see a version of this site that's more than a half decade old!
  Don't judge it too harshly, my standards have improved since I was a student.

<p>
  The couple of Python CGI scripts it had, which were originally placeholders
  to be replaced by CS5 students' own work, have mostly already been ported into
  JavaScript (since it's a bit easier to host and zero effort to configure) and
  expanded on, and will continue to appear on the <a href="#projects">Projects</a>
  tab as they're completed&mdash;maybe even as separate git subtrees! ... Eventually.
